* Intro

*herbie* is helper for managing a [[https://herbstluftwm.org/][herbstluftwm]] interactive environment.
Interactivity is provide through keybindings and [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] and the
[[https://github.com/miphreal/python-rofi-menu][rofi-menu]] Python interface.

* Documentation

You are reading it.  This file is it.  You can see it rendered by
[[https://github.com/brettviren/herbie/blob/master/README.org][github]] or more beautifully by [[https://brettviren.github.io/herbie/][Emacs]] (with the help of [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][fniessen's ReadTheOrg]])

* Installation

*herbie* attempts to be a well behaved Python package so install it as such however you normally do.  Recommended:

#+begin_example
uv tool install git+https://github.com/brettviren/herbie
#+end_example

However, you may first need:
#+begin_example
apt install libgirepository1.0-dev
#+end_example

*herbie* is also on PyPI as *herbstluft-herbie*.

* Usage

The *herbie* package provides a ~herbie~ command line program.  Run it to print a
brief help message:

#+begin_example
$ herbie
Usage: herbie [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -h, --hc TEXT         Set the herbstclient executable name
  -c, --config PATH     Set configuration file
  -l, --log-file TEXT   Set log file, default is terminal
  -L, --log-level TEXT  Set log level
  --help                Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  hooks    Start herbie loop and respond react to herbstlufwm hooks
  version  Print the version
#+end_example

* Hooks

Once started, *herbie* is long-running and the primary measns to communicate it is with herbstlufwm "hooks".  *herbie* will react to standard and custom hooks.  For example,

#+begin_example
$ herbstclient emit_hook window_jump_tag
#+end_example

Or, when herbstlufwm restarts, it emits the ~restart~ hook and *herbie* will react
by restarting itself.  Every hook is handled by a method in the ~Herbie~ class of
hte same name.  See that class for a definitive list but here are some of the
existing hook handlers:

- ~window_jump_tag~ :: opens a rofi menu for jumping to a window in the current tag.

- ~window_jump_any~ :: as above but include all windows across tabs.

- ~window_menu~ :: open a menu on current window to apply some operation (close,
  minimize, toggle some property like floating or fullscreen).

- ~layout_{drop,save,load}~ :: open a menu to operate on layouts (see below)

- ~task_{start,clear}~ :: open a menu to operate on tasks (see below).

Many of the hooks that *herbie* reacts to are most conveniently emitted via a key
binding.  Here is a snippet of =~/.config/herbstluftwm/autostart= that shows some
examples:

#+begin_example
# emit to herbie
hc keybind $Mod-n        emit_hook window_jump_tag
hc keybind $Mod-Shift-n  emit_hook window_jump_any
hc keybind $Mod-w        emit_hook window_menu
# k for kill
hc keybind $Mod-k       emit_hook layout_drop
# capital-K for "keep"?
hc keybind $Mod-Shift-k emit_hook layout_save
# y for yank
hc keybind $Mod-y       emit_hook layout_load
hc keybind $Mod-i       emit_hook task_start
hc keybind $Mod-Shift-i emit_hook task_clear
#+end_example


* Layouts

A "layout" is a description of how herbstluftwm places windows in a tag.  For example, you may see the layout of your current tag with: 

#+begin_example
$ herbstclient dump
(split horizontal:0.5:0 (clients grid:0 0x120000e) (clients grid:0 0x3c00142))
#+end_example

*herbie* has support for managing a persistent store of layouts and applying them.  It does this by presenting the user with a rofi menu in response to the ~layout_{drop,save,load}~ hooks.

The menu items include the layout name as well as a little icon that *herbie* generates to show the window outlines in the layout.  Here is an example:


[[file:docs/layouts.png]]


Layouts are saved in:

#+begin_example
~/.config/herbie/layouts/<tag>/<name>.layout
#+end_example

The user may create or edit these files by hand but perhaps it is easiest to configure a layout via herbstluftwm and then save it.

#+begin_note
Layouts from ~herbstclient dump~ include a window ID number and these may appear
in ~.layout~ files.  This window ID is ignored by *herbie*.
#+end_note

* Tasks

Tasks are like layouts with added support for starting applications.  They are configured through the *herbie* config file

#+begin_example
~/.config/herbie/herbie.cfg
#+end_example

A task is specified in a form similar to a herbstluftwm layout but the ~(clients)~ form supports an additional ~window:<name>~ field.  It specifies an application that should exist in the herbstluftwm frame.  This is most clear with an example:

#+begin_example
[window firefox-rss]
title = Mozilla Firefox
command = firefox -P rss-profile

[window liferea]
class = Liferea
command = liferea

[tasks]
rss = (split horizontal:0.75:1
        (clients window:firefox-rss)
        (split vertical:0.50:0
          (clients window:liferea)
          (clients )))

#+end_example

Each ~[window <name>]~ gives a ~command~ to run to populate the frame while the ~class~ or ~title~ gives string that is used to match these client attributes as may be found with, for example:

#+begin_example
herbstclient attr clients.<window-id>.{title,class}
#+end_example

When ~task_start~ hook is received, *herbie* will present a rofi menu with all known tasks.  Selecting one will create a tag with that task, assure the configured applications are present and following the layout and make that tag current.  If the tag already exists, *herbie* will simply make it become the current tag.  
The result is an automatically and repeatably populated tag.

* Todo

- [ ] Layouts should be definable in ~herbie.cfg~ and that set should be a union
  of what is manged in ~layouts/~.

- [ ] The task layout should be considered without needing to be redefined
  explicitly as a layout.

- [ ] The OG *herbie* kept a custom ~my_focused_time~ window attribute so that it
  can implement a "switch to last used window" operation.  This has become
  broken in the new async version.

- [ ] *herbie* modules starting with "a" for "async" are largely current.  The
  rest is mostly cruft remaining from the old, non-async version.  It should be
  integrated or purged.
